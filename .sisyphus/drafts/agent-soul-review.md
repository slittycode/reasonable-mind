# Draft: Agent Soul Review

## Requirements (confirmed)
- Repository review request focuses on understanding prior AI council project holistically from read-only perspective
- Goal is to extract logic/use-case insights for future sol.md agent constitution
- Review must consider broader personal use case and desired agent soul/constitution description

## Technical Decisions
- Pending

## Research Findings
- Repository structure summary received (top directories, key docs, tests)
- Core metaphysical document: agents/ARCHITECTURE_METAPHYSICS.md defines skeleton/muscle/heart metaphor
- Metaphysics doc elaborates separation of concerns, dependency rules, override hierarchy, design/forbidden patterns for logic/AI/user layers
- Neuro-symbolic implementation doc describes symbol grounding, epistemic separation
- Neuro-symbolic doc details solutions to symbol grounding, epistemic vs validity, fallacy detection, confidence propagation, quantifier handling, modality detection
- Architectural tests enforce metaphysical invariants
- Architectural tests module validates deterministic logic, multi-perspective AI, user overrides, synthesis explanations, forbidden imports, dependency rules
- Governance modules ensure user agency overrides
- Root README outlines mission: bridge deterministic logic + probabilistic LLMs via 8-layer architecture (Perception→Observability)
- Metaphysics implementation summary catalogues deliverables, validation suite (>50 tests), architectural mapping by layer, and future profile/logic expansion roadmap
- Architecture implementation summary reiterates triadic model, compliance audits, layer markers, and provides diagrams + demos for synthesis
- Extended Thinking doc defines 6-step Watson Glaser-inspired reasoning pipeline, 4 analytic layers, curriculum gating, config guidance
- 8X architecture reference recommends 8-layer logic-prioritized stack (two logic layers weighted 75%) for production reasoning

## Open Questions
- None yet

## Scope Boundaries
- INCLUDE: structural/logic analysis, identifying unique patterns or soul-defining artifacts
- EXCLUDE: making code changes, executing commands that modify repo
